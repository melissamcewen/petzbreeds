# Honkerz 2.0

This is an update to the port from Oddballz to Petz by [Carolyn's Creations](https://homebody.eu/carolyn/).

- Place the `color181.bmp` texture in `Resources/Furfiles/Colors`
- You may need to create a "furfiles" directory
- For sounds download the [honk sounds from Carolyn](https://homebody.eu/carolyn/sounds.htm) and put them in `Resources/Furfiles/Colors`

Changes
- Nose changed to outline "draw as nose"
- Eye group changed to -1 so the color won't mutate
- New texture allows the purple color to mutate. It takes advantage of some weirdness related to transparent textures being altered by the texture underneath them. It can mutate to pink, light brown, yellow, light yellow, off white, grey, teal, and black.
- Original honker described as "HONKER: SLEEPY & DOGLIKE" in the Oddballz files so I've edited the breed's personality to be more sleepy and set dogginess to 100
